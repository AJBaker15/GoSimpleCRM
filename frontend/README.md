# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Expanded on the Vite template that is given on install. 
The frontend is not completely finished. You can test by running the app and using the standard 
username = "admin"
password = "admin"
to see that the log in is successful for the frontend. 
Keep an eye on updates in the github repo for functionality.
